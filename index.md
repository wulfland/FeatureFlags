# Feature Flag Solutions

## What are Feature Flags?

`Feature Flags` are a technique in software development that allows to modify runtime behavior without changing code. It decouples the releasing of functionality to the end users from the roll-out of the binaries.
`Feature Flags` work like a switch or toggle and are therefore often called `Feature Toggles` or `Feature Switches` because of there Boolean nature. But `Feature Flags` can have many different use cases and can be more complex than a toggle. Thatâ€™s why the tern Feature Flag is more suitable.

## Available Feature Flag Solutions

There are many solutions out there. I'm first focusing on all the available `products` - and not on individual frammeworks. Maybe I add this later. This is the criteria I will look for:

- Pricing
- License
- Available SDKs
- Hosting Options
- Compliance

These are the solutions I found so far. Feel free to contact ne if I missed anything:

A seat is a team member that logs into the portal using a unique email address.
The MAUs are the active unique users - so every user only counts once - even if they evaluate flags from multiple devices.
